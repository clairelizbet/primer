        <p>
          This page is for verifying that Primer styles are being applied
          correctly in the browser when using layouts that depend on the body
          being full height. Additional flex-grow column layout styles have been
          applied.

        <h2>Sizing</h2>

        <p>
          The content should be displayed with a green background and a small
          gap between each of the three elements. It should be surrounded on the
          left and right by blue. It should take up the full height of the
          viewport but not be covered by any browser UI and not trigger a
          vertical scroll when viewed on a sufficiently tall display.
