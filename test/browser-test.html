        Must go faster. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to
        decompose. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? What do they
        got in there? King Kong? God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. I
        was part of something special. Remind me to thank John for a lovely
        weekend.

        You really think you can fly that thing? God creates dinosaurs. God
        destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates
        Dinosaurs. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck.
        You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and
        ideas. Do you need a manager?

        What do they got in there? King Kong? Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it
        really exist? You really think you can fly that thing? My dad once told
        me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you
        something to cry about you little bastard!
